LD39 theme: running out of power

You are POV, and you must launch the Ludum Dare theme at 04:00 Helsinki time! Which is some other time in other places, but no one cares about those other places.

So it's 3:55 and of course, the server is running out of power. Because everyone wants to know the theme!

You must push the 6 buttons to launch the theme, but you must also keep the power going! Oh noes!
